The user wants more activities that are:
1. More romantic
2. PG-13 rated (not G-rated anymore)

This means I can be more flirtatious, suggestive, and intimate while still keeping it appropriate. PG-13 allows for:
- More physical touch (appropriate)
- Flirtation and attraction
- Mild sensuality (kissing, cuddling, compliments about physical appearance)
- More direct romantic/intimate conversation
- Teasing and playful seduction
- Still no explicit content

I should create activities that:
- Have more physical connection
- Are more directly flirtatious
- Include attraction and desire elements
- Are more "bedroom adjacent" without crossing lines
- Feel steamy but tasteful
- Would make couples feel excited/turned on in a playful way

Let me create 30 activities at the PG-13 romantic level.

Here are 30 MORE activities that are PG-13 romantic - flirtier, more physical, and definitely for couples only:
