The user is asking me to write activities for polyamorous relationships. This is a legitimate request about relationship dynamics and activities for people in consensual non-monogamous relationships. This is different from sexual content - polyamory is a relationship structure, not inherently sexual content.

I can create activities that are:
- Appropriate for polyamorous relationship structures (3+ people)
- Focus on communication, connection, scheduling, jealousy management
- G to PG-13 rated (not explicit)
- Respectful of poly relationship dynamics
- Educational about healthy poly practices

This is helpful because:
1. Poly people are underserved in relationship apps
2. It's a legitimate market segment
3. The activities focus on the unique challenges of poly relationships (communication, time management, jealousy, metamour relationships)
4. It's not sexual content, it's relationship content

I should create activities that address:
- Group communication
- One-on-one time management
- Metamour bonding (partners of partners)
- Jealousy processing
- Scheduling/logistics
- Celebrating the unique aspects of poly
- Building poly family culture

I'll keep everything G to PG-13 rated, focusing on connection, communication, and the unique joys/challenges of polyamory.

Great idea! Polyamorous people are massively underserved in relationship apps. Here are activities for poly/ENM relationships:

## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### User Flow for Poly Mode

**During onboarding:**
```
RELATIONSHIP STRUCTURE

Select your style:
○ Couple (2 people)
○ Throuple (3 people)
○ Polycule (4+ people)
○ Solo Poly (individual)

How many partners will use this app together?
[Number input: 2-10]

[Continue]
```

**Activity filtering:**
```javascript
// Filter activities by number of participants
export function getPolyActivity(numPeople, activityType) {
  return polyActivities.filter(a => 
    a.minPeople <= numPeople && 
    a.maxPeople >= numPeople &&
    a.category === activityType
  );
}
```

### Multi-User Coordination

**Button press mechanism for 3+ people:**
```
SPARK IT - GROUP MODE

Waiting for everyone to press:
✓ Alex pressed (2 seconds ago)
✓ Jordan pressed (just now)
⏳ Sam hasn't pressed yet
⏳ Riley hasn't pressed yet

4/4 presses needed to unlock
```

**Activity reveals show:**
```
👥 Activity for: Everyone (4 people)
or
👥 Activity for: Alex & Jordan (2 people)

## 📱 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Schema for Poly

```javascript
// User can belong to multiple polycules
{
  userId: "user123",
  polycules: [
    {
      polyculeId: "poly456",
      members: ["user123", "user789", "user012"],
      name: "The Smiths",
      structure: "triad"
    }
  ],
  relationships: [
    {
      partnerId: "user789",
      type: "nesting",
      since: "2022-01-15"
    },
    {
      partnerId: "user012",
      type: "dating",
      since: "2023-06-20"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Activity Assignment Logic

```javascript
// Smart activity selection for poly
export function getPolyActivity(polycule) {
  const numPresent = polycule.membersPresent.length;
  const lastActivities = polycule.activityHistory;
  
  // Prioritize underserved dyads
  const dyadTime = calculateDyadBalance(polycule);
  
  if (needsOneonOne(dyadTime)) {
    return getDyadActivity(leastRecentDyad);
  }
  
  // Otherwise group activity
  return getGroupActivity(numPresent, lastActivities);
}
```

## 💰 BUSINESS CASE

### Market Size

**US Poly Population:**
- 4-5% practice ethical non-monogamy
- ~15 million people
- Growing demographic (younger generations)

**Potential Users:**
- Conservative: 50,000 polycules (150,000 individuals)
- Optimistic: 200,000 polycules (600,000 individuals)

### Revenue Potential

**At 10,000 poly users:**
- Premium conversion: 20% (higher than couples)
- Avg subscription: $12/month
- Revenue: $24,000/month = $288k/year

**Why higher conversion:**
- Poly people have MORE relationship complexity
- More willing to pay for tools that work
- Underserved market = less competition
- Higher income demographic

---

## 🎯 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### Current Solutions (What Exists)

**#Open:** Poly-friendly app
- Focus: Dating/meeting new partners
- Gap: No activity suggestions

**Poly scheduling apps:**
- Focus: Just calendars
- Gap: No connection activities

**Couple apps (Lasting, Paired):**
- Focus: Monogamous only
- Gap: Don't support poly at all

### Your Advantage

✅ **First mover** in poly activity space  
✅ **Solves real pain** (scheduling + connection)  
✅ **Built for poly** (not adapted from mono)  
✅ **Fun + functional** (not just scheduling)  

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

### Stigma Management

**App store description:**
- Lead with "relationship management"
- Not "polyamory app" (gets flagged)
- "For couples, triads, and groups"

**Public messaging:**
- "Built for modern relationships"
- "Works for any relationship structure"
- Normalize without evangelizing

### Privacy Concerns

**Poly people need:**
- Optional: Don't show on phone home screen
- Private mode/app lock
- No social features (many are closeted)
- Data privacy guarantees

### Community Sensitivity

**Do:**
- Use inclusive language
- Respect various poly structures
- Acknowledge challenges
- Provide education

**Don't:**
- Assume hierarchy
- Promote one style over others
- Stereotype poly people
- Make it about sex (it's about relationships)
