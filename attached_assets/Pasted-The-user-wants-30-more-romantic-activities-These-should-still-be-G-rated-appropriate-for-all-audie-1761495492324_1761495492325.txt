The user wants 30 more romantic activities. These should still be G-rated (appropriate for all audiences) but more focused on romance, connection, intimacy (non-sexual), affection, and building emotional closeness. They should be flirtatious but not explicit.

I'll create activities that focus on:
- Eye contact and connection
- Touch (appropriate - hand holding, hugs, massage, etc.)
- Vulnerability and sharing
- Appreciation and gratitude
- Quality time and attention
- Creating romantic atmosphere
- Memory making
- Future planning together
- Acts of service
- Words of affirmation

I'll vary the duration and keep them practical and immediately doable.

Here are 30 MORE romantic, connection-focused activities (still G-rated but more intimate):
